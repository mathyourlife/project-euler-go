It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along
the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting
is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals
are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral
above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
If this process is continued, what is the side length of
the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along
both diagonals first falls below 10%?
